# Classification_models

Current project is under construction. 

The project is based on a set of data to classify which customers will deposit money to their bank accounts based on promotional interest rates and customer history. Several models were developed for this project, such as Decision trees, random forest, AdaBoost, etc. This project is based on a binary classification problem where a '0' denotes NO and '1' denotes YES for the Target feature. In this binary classification problem, important features were also extracted so that the project gives a deeper insight as to which features are important compared to the rest.
